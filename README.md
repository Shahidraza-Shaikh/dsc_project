# Project Title :- Disease Prediction System using X-rays or MRI and provide information,precautions measures and recommend doctors based on that.

# Aim           :- 
                  To create such a system where person can check or predict their Disease using X-Rays, MRI 
                  i.e. Brain Tumor,Pneumonia,Breast Cancer,Covid or based on symptoms i.e. Heart Disease Based 
                  predicted disease user will get information like natual remidies, Exercise, Diet, Recommend doctor etc.

# Features      :- 
                   basically Doctors can check two or limited X-rays for perticular disease while our system 
                   can check hundred's of X-rays in limited amount of time with   accuracy and faster and even show information of disease and precautions and even recommend doctors for infected person.

# Future Scope  :- 
                   We will add some features like we will increase the number of disease and even information and even medicine.


# Description   : -
                  Our system consist of 5 diseases for prediction and provide information,natural way to cure and healthy diet, Exercise, recommended doctor for infected user.

                  
# Technology Used : -
                  Deep learning algorithm to train the models like CNN, Transfer learning (vgg16).
                  We have use TensorFlow, keras, Opencv module for training model.
                  Django framework to create a website and for Deploying the DL models into our website.
                  Html,css,javascript,bootstrap for User Interface
                  programming language we use is python for All logical stuff like model training, django implementation.
